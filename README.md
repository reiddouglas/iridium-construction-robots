# Iridium Construction Robots

A factorio mod that adds later-game iridium contruction robots into space exploration that are quicker and more durable than their counterparts with the aim of reducing the amount of time you spend restocking biter-heavy planets with construction robots while also providing a upgrade that feels impactful, but not utterly game breaking, by making the robots move more quickly.

Their benefits relative to normal contruction robots are as follows:

- 5x the health
- 2x the speed
- Complete fire immunity
- Halved damage from most other sources of damage

## Reasearch Requirements

The new-and-improved robots are gated behind material science 3, so it will take a while to get them. Though, the benefits of getting them are more than worth it.
